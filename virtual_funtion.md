## Virtual Function

A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function. 

```
// CPP program to illustrate
// concept of Virtual Functions

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void print()
	{
		cout << "print base class" << endl;
	}

	void show()
	{
		cout << "show base class" << endl;
	}
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void print()
	{
		cout << "print derived class" << endl;
	}

	void show()
	{
		cout << "show derived class" << endl;
	}
};

int main()
{
	base* bptr;
	derived d;
	bptr = &d;

	// virtual function, binded at runtime
	bptr->print();

	// Non-virtual function, binded at compile time
	bptr->show();
}
```

output

```
print derived class
show base class
```
